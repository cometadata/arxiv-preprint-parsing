# arXiv Preprint Parsing

This is the code repository for the COMET initiative enrichment project: 'Improve affiliations parsing of preprints'. Refer to the [Project Hub](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaXIKgIO4fbtF_o2rJRpTawiOD9Re6YLgtdIm_RcJkc/edit?usp=sharing) for a full description of the project and information on getting involved.

## Objective

To improve structured metadata extraction (authors, ORCIDs, affiliations) from preprints by addressing format variability, and concurrently assess the quality of the current GROBID-based text extraction workflow.
